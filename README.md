#Python-Challenges

**Two Python scripting Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll
  
  *PyBank - create a Python script analyzing the financial records of a company given set of financial data composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`

* Task is to create a Python script that analyzes records to calculate each of the following:
  * The total number of months included in the dataset
  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  * In addition, final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results
  
  *PyPoLL - create Python script helping small, rural town modernize its vote counting process given a set of poll data composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. 
  
 * Task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:
    * The total number of votes cast
    * A complete list of candidates who received votes
    * The percentage of votes each candidate won
    * The total number of votes each candidate won
    * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
